# NLP-Project
In this project, you will use natural language processing (NLP) to assess how closely two films' plots, as listed on IMDb and Wikipedia, resemble one another since movies within a genre often share common base parameters. The dataset includes the top 100 films on IMDb along with story summaries for each film taken from IMDb and Wikipedia.
